# Overview
This [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) module adds support for projected walls which are needed when using isometric or 3D-projected maps. This works by adding dynamic walls at runtime, just in the right position to produce the correct vision cone. Still 2D and not perfect, but a lot better than static walls. Such maps can be produced using [Unity2Foundry](https://github.com/CoolcatFVTT/Unity2Foundry-Project).

[Unity2Foundry](https://github.com/CoolcatFVTT/Unity2Foundry-Project) is a toolset that allows you to render maps from within [Unity Editor](https://unity.com/), while also generating wall-data for [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/). That means you can use tools like [ProBuilder](https://unity.com/features/probuilder) and/or get some 3D game assets from the [Unity AssetStore](https://assetstore.unity.com/).

Some screenshots of FoundryVTT scenes made for the [StarTrek Adventures](https://www.modiphius.net/collections/star-trek-adventures) episode 'The Ångström operation' from the second mission compendium. Note that the compatible [Shared Vision module by CDeenen](https://github.com/CDeenen/SharedVision) was also used for those screenshots.
